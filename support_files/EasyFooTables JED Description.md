EasyFooTables is a Joomla 3.x implementation of the [FooTables plugin for WordPress](http://fooplugins.com/footable-demos/) from the awesome [FooPlugins people](http://fooplugins.com).

EasyFooTables implements a Joomla content plugin using the traditional curly braces syntax `{}` and can be used anywhere a content plugin will work.

Simple place `{footables}` in any article, Custom HTML module or wherever else you find content plugins work and the plugin will add the necessary FooTables Query plugin to the page and install the initialisation script.

All you have to do then is add the `footable` class to your `table` tag and some `data-hide` attributes to the table headings and you're good to go!
